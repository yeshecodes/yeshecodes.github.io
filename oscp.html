    <h1 class="section-title">Log: OSCP_Certification_Journey</h1>
    <p>In 2024, after completing my <span class="highlight">MSc in Computer Science and Cybersecurity</span> I decided to pursue the <span class="highlight"></span>OSCP</span>. My MsC provided the theoretical foundation. <span class="highlight">OSCP</span> was the crucible that tested my practical endurance.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>I started with IT familiarity.</p>
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Hobbyist MERN full stack developer:</span> I had 3-4 years of hobbyist experience building non-pro websites.
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Certs earned between 2021 and 2026:</span> - Not an ordered or complete list - Cyber Scheme CSTM, MSc Computer Science & Cybersecurity, Comptia Pentest+, Cyber Scheme VA+ ...CWL AD Red Team Specialist, CWL Certified Web Red Team Analyst, INE Certified Junior & Professional Penetration Tester... 
                <br>• <span class="highlight">IT professional:</span> Spent time in Cybersecurity, IT support, System administrator roles. 
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Self-motivated:</span> I generally enjoy earning certs, taking courses and have always enjoyed IT, Computer Science, Cybersecurity hence my MsC.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Resources and Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>I find it slightly difficult to recommend the best path for others. Enjoy the journey and the certifications will come. It is less about a single resource and consistently doing something each day and practicing specific skills.</p>
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Tryhackme:</span> This was my initial resource for learning the core penetration testing concepts in a structured and gamified manner. I completed several learning paths, the courses are interactive and the labs are engaging.
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Hackthebox:</span> This was my step-up into the CPTS course, and the other HTB labs which is a bit more training wheels off. I also competed in seasons 7 earning the following ranks (Silver), 8 (Ruby), 9 (Ruby) of HTB Seasons.
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Proving Grounds:</span> This was my final resource. I worked through 30-40 boxes using Lain's list
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Videos:</span> IPPsec and TJNull walkthrough's
                <br>• <span class="highlight">List</span> Lain's list

                <h3>0x01: The Lab Phase</h3>
                <p>I purchase the 90 day bundle which included 1 exam attempt. I balanced my full-time cybersecurity role and learning with labs, I studied the course material and worked through the practice labs</p>
                <br>• <span class="highlight">A few hours a day:</span> I took the odd day off. However I was generally consistent about having a lab on the go each day.
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Notes:</span> I took notes. I used cherrytree and switch to Obsidian and using both.
                <br>• <span class="highlight">Smaller certs:</span> I sought out opportunities to benchmark against, so I made use of very affordable courses with an exam component, especially CWL, Pentesting Exams (Secops) etc.

                <h3>0x02: Hills and valleys</h3>
                <p>Failed at first. I thought it best not to stress too much. I would study harder and return for another try. Overall the cooling-off period helped me improve. </p>
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">Yes, I failed at first</span> My preparation was not good enough, my time management, skills and performance were not at the required level.
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">I still submitted the failing report</span> I figured it was good practice and validated my reporting approach.
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">Back to the drawing board</span> I signed up for Proving Grounds labs and spent more time learning and purchased another exam voucher.

                <h3>0x03: The passing Exam</h3>
                <p>I started around midday. I would hack for 2-3 hours and then take short 15 minute breaks. Those helped alot to breathe, drink water and think.
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">Fully completed AD Set:</span> Completed all AD flags by the 4th hour.
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">Rooted 1st standalone:</span> Completed this by the 6th hour.
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">Foothold on 2nd standalone:</span> Foothold flag by the 9th hour
                <p>I had earned enough points to pass, so I began taking vigorous screenshots and building my report notes and went to sleep.</p>
                   <br>• <span class="highlight">Foothold on 3rd standalone:</span> Foothold flag with 3 hours remaining</p>
                <p>I had earned over the requirement. I double and triple checked my notes, screenshots, control panel submissions and ended the exam.</p>

                <br>• <span class="highlight">Take a break:</span> I slept and refreshed before report writing.
                <p>I had already written my report during the exam. It was a matter of putting it onto the official template. This did take me a while to double and triple check.<span class="highlight"> Submitted the report</span> I submitted about 14 hours after the exam ended <span class="highlight">Waited...:</span> then suddenly, success!</p>
